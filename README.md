# Risk-prediction
Python and Matlab code to load eye movement features and predict risk windows on a hazard identification task with driving videos.

A decision support system for Risk assessment. Applied model Selection in the Python Jupyter notebook to compare the best feature based on eye movements for predicting risk assesment.

The data are from 32 subjects who watched 20 driving clips. Each row identifies a period of 1 second within trials. Subjects identified with a button press those moments where they thought the car should brake. Data include evenly windows before and independent of subject's report.

Variables included are:

1) A Risk status: positive or negative.

2) Demographic variables: age, race, gender.

3) Eye movement variables: Saccadic magnitude, number of fixations, fixation duration, dispersion in x, dispersion in y, number of blinks, pupil size
